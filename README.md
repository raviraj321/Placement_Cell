use open APIs [example: https://jobs.github.com/api, find at least one more, you can
cheat!]
- The API request should be handled from your node.js server
- The design of this page should be minimalistic
- Link to apply would be an external link, so don’t worry about creating
models/controllers/views for any part on this page
- Download a complete CSV of all the data with the following columns:
- Student id, student name, student college, student status, DSA Final Score, WebD Final
Score, React Final Score, interview date, interview company, interview student result
